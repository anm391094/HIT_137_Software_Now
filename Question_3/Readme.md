## 📌 Overview

This Python application uses the `turtle` graphics module to generate a visually appealing recursive tree structure. The user provides branch angles, length, depth, and a reduction factor to control the tree's appearance. The tree is drawn recursively with a natural branching pattern, using different colors and thicknesses for trunk and branches.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Understand and apply recursion in a graphical context.
- Use user input to dynamically alter output.
- Apply basic graphical programming using Python's `turtle` module.
- Practice clean code structure with functions and parameter passing.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Recursive tree drawing based on user-defined parameters.
- Customizable angles for left and right branches.
- Configurable recursion depth and branch reduction factor.
- Differentiated coloring and thickness for trunk (`brown`) and branches (`green`).
- Handles invalid user input with basic validation.

## 🖥️ How to Run

### ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.x (tested with Python 3.11)
- No external libraries required (uses built-in `turtle` module)

### ▶️ Execution

1. Open terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script with:

   ```bash
   python generates_a_tree_pattern.py
   ```
