## 📌 **Overview**

This Python application uses the **Caesar Cipher** encryption technique to encrypt and decrypt text. The user provides a shift value (`n`) and a key (`m`), which determine how the text will be transformed. The program allows users to input text, encrypt it, and then decrypt it, ensuring that the original message can be recovered. The program saves the original text, encrypted text, and decrypted text into separate files for easy validation.

## 🧠 **Learning Objectives**

- Understand and apply **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption algorithms.
- Implement **file I/O** to read and write text files.
- Apply basic **string manipulation** and **mathematical transformations** for text encryption.
- Practice exception handling and user input validation.

---

## 🛠️ **Features**

- Encrypt and decrypt text using **Caesar Cipher** with user-defined shift values.
- Save the original text, encrypted text, and decrypted text to separate files.
- Validate the decrypted text against the original to ensure correctness.
- Handles invalid inputs through basic exception handling.
