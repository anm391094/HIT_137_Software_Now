## 📌 **Overview**

This Python application analyzes **temperature data** from various stations over multiple years. The program reads data from **CSV files** and calculates seasonal averages for each station. It also identifies the station with the **largest temperature range** and finds the **warmest** and **coolest** stations based on the provided data. The results are saved into **text files** for easy review and validation.

## 🧠 **Learning Objectives**

- Perform data analysis using **Pandas** to process CSV files and manipulate temperature data.
- Calculate seasonal averages for temperature data across multiple years.
- Identify stations with the **largest temperature range**, and find the **warmest** and **coolest** stations.
- Handle and manipulate real-world data, then output the results in text files.

## 🛠️ **Features**

- Read and process temperature data from multiple **CSV files**.
- Calculate seasonal averages for each station (Dry and Wet seasons).
- Identify the **station with the largest temperature range**.
- Find the **warmest** and **coolest stations** based on the calculated averages.
- Save the results in **`average_temp.txt`**, **`largest_temp_range_station.txt`**, and **`warmest_and_coolest_station.txt`**.
